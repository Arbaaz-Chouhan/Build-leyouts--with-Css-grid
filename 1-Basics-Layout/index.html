            <h2>Balloon Magic</h2>
            <p>
              Balloons are used for decorating birthday parties, weddings, corporate functions, school events, and for other festive gatherings.
              The artists who use the round balloons to build are called "stackers" and the artists who use pencil balloons to build are called "twisters.
               Most commonly associated with helium balloon decor, more recently balloon decorators have been moving towards the creation of air-filled balloon decorations due to the non-renewable natural resource of helium limited in supply.
              The most common types of balloon decor include arches, columns, centerpieces, balloon drops, sculptures, and balloon bouquets.
               With the increased aptitude for balloon twisting as well as balloon stacking, the rise of the deco-twister manifests itself as the combination of stacking techniques as well as twisting techniques to create unique and interesting balloon decor options.
