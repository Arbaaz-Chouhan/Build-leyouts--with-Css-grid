            <p>Available on: PS4, Xbox One, PC, PS5, Xbox Series X  No Man’s Sky has turned into a fulfilling voyage around the star system that’ll have you trotting through procedurally-generated planets like the interstellar explorer you are. 
                It’s now got 30 hours of story content, new lore, different ways to interact with its NPCs, portals to make jumping between planets a ton easier, and terraforming. The No Man Sky's Beyond(opens in new tab) 
                update brought even more features and changes, including ridable aliens, a new social systemand VR support.
                And updates since have added more features, more story, and even more reasons to get lost in space. Forget open world: No Man’s Sky is an open galaxy, and you should absolutely jump into it if you look good in a spacesuit and love discovering exotic alien wildlife.</p>
